# BlackWinterSecurity

### The following shell script was designed to install the following tools:
- SecList
- StegCracker
- RsaCtfTool
- Veil-Evasion

### How to use:
To install all of the tools, run the following command:
./blackwintersecurity.sh

To install a standalone tool, run the following command:
./standaloneinstaller.sh <InstallerPackage>

Current Options:
- RsaCtfTool
- SecList
- StegCracker
- VeilEvasion

If you wish to install only a subset of tools you have 2 options:
1. You can edit the blackwintersecurity.sh file and comment out the sections you don't want.
2. You can run the standaloneinstaller.sh script.

Looking to add a bunch more tools via this script.
