# BlackWinterSecurity

### The following shell script was designed to install the following tools:
- SecList
- StegCracker
- RsaCtfTool
- Veil-Evasion
- PwnTools

### How to use:
To install all of the tools, run the following command:
```sh
./blackwintersecurity.sh
```

To install a standalone tool, run the following command:
```sh
Usage: ./standaloneinstaller.sh [Installer]
Installers:
  SecList
  VeilEvasion
  RsaCtfTool
  StegCracker
  PwnTools
Examples:
 ./standaloneinstaller.sh SecList
 ./standaloneinstaller.sh VeilEvasion

```

If you wish to install only a subset of tools you have 2 options:
1. You can edit the blackwintersecurity.sh file and comment out the sections you don't want.
2. You can run the standaloneinstaller.sh script.

Looking to add a bunch more tools via this script.
